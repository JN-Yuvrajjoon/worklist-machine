## LOGIC
- Program the worklist generator that takes in course names, retreives Course documents from mongoDB, and outputs several worklists (collections of sections) (+ links, possibly)

## SCRAPER
- Program the scraper that takes course website data and stores it in the database. This might be a separate program.
- Get the scraper to ask whether a course is full/blocked/restricted, show restrictions, show comments

## MISC FRONTEND
- CoursesMenu: enable deletion of courses
